# ME-Project
Repository for Final Year Project.

This project hopes to provide a software framework that will support textured 3D reconstruction for single RGB images. First, the Shapenet dataset will be utilised to train a Point Set Gen based neural network which will create a point cloud based on a single RGB image input.

Packages specified in `requirements.txt` file are not currently exhaustive.
